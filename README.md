# About my Financial Dashboard

Developed a user-centric homepage and a dynamic router page for the efficient display of stocks and financial data, sourced from Financial Modeling Prep's API. Engineered a feature-rich interface. All the components in my React app incorporate real-time stock data, including prices, percentage changes, price change graphs, and other relevant information for the respective tickers.
