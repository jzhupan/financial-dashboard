# About my Financial Dashboard
I have been actively enhancing my proficiency in front-end technologies, which include JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, Next.js, JSX syntax, Material UI, Recharts, and Financial Modeling Prepâ€™s API. Through this project, I had the opportunity to build a dynamic Financial Dashboard from scratch, practice API integration using Axios, resolve numerous CSS issues while working with Material UI components, and experiment with styling customization.

## Key Acomplisments:
  - Developed a user-friendly Home page and a dynamic router page.
    
  - The application displays daily stock data and other financial information by utilizing the Financial Modeling Prep's API.
    
  - Crafted a feature-rich interface that encompasses:
    
     - Navbar

     - Search bar
   
     - Marquee
       
     - News section
       
     - Info Table
       
     - Stock Charts
       
     - Sidebar
All of these components incorporate real-time stock data, including prices, percentage changes, and other relevant information for the respective ticker.
