# financial-dashboard
Will be using React to create this project and other libraries and frameworks with a focus on CSS and Responsive Design, I will also use little of back-end as well to have a complete web app.

One of the current goals is refresh my memory a bit on the backend aspect and pull data from a finance public API with React.
